Feature Added: Calorie Count for all foods generated by the LLM and a total calorie count displayed alongside the total price
The feature was added to the structure of Ingredient in main.jac and in frontend.impl.jac a function that summed the calories similarly to the generated prices was added.
These were then used to add individual ingredient and total calorie count to the styles.css and frontend.cl.jac 

A Jac client-side application with React support.
